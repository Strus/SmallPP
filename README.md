# SmallPP

SmallPP is an objective-oriented framework for C. Like small C++. Small CPP. SmallPP. Ok, I will stop.

## Why?

A couple years ago I've worked in Cubiware (later Rovi later TiVo later Xperi... new year - new owner). We made
software for Set-Top Boxes which was written in C. But it wasn't an ordinary C codebase - we had an objective-oriented
framework! And it was great, it has inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, standard library with data types like
string, hash table, array etc. Super cool stuff.

I thought it would be a cool exercise to try to implement something like that on my own. Of course I will not use any
propertiary code from Cubiware. I don't have it, I don't remember most of it - and even if I did, I would break a license.

## Features

Currently implemented features:

* single object inheritance
  * virtual function calls
